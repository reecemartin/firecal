FIRE or "Financial Independence Retire Early" is an interesting lifestyle where one tries to maximize their savings and grow a signficiant
enough investment portfolio that they can live off of it (or reduce their working hours significantly). Trying to achieve FIRE involves
various recurring calculations, so it seems sensible to try to create a command line application which can automate and assist in these
routine calculations.

Some example tasks to simplify:

- Calculate annual investment returns
- Generate year by year returns for a given account given an investment (savings) and return rate
- Generate year by year returns for an entire portfolio of accounts
- Determine the time needed to reach a certain level of annual investment returns

### Design

- Purchase comparator which allows you to compare two product options - say a razor and electric trimmer, with base and recurring costs to see which is less expensive and over what period of time
